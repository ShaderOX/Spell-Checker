In the Python implementation there is a module process, which is used to compare e.g. a string to a list of strings. In Python this both saves the time to implement those features yourself and can be a lot more efficient than repeated type conversions between Python and C++. Implementing a similar function in C++ using templates is not easily possible and probably slower than impldsdsdementing them on your own. Thats why this section describes how users can implement those features with a couple lines of code using the C++ library
